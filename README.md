Hello GitHub!

I'm Ben from the UK. I have been learning to code with HTML, CSS and Python as well as building basic websites. 

In the process of deciding on a bootcamp to attend! Le Wagon or a new economic development program in Calgary are the two choices. One is in Calgary "funnily enough", and the other would probably be LeWagon Bali. So cold and expensive for 6 months, or hot and exciting for 8 weeks...
